# Class Topic/Projects
These are the topics/projects covered in class.

## CS 010C - Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

Topics include basic data structures such as arrays, lists, stacks, and queues. Covers dictionaries (including binary search trees and hashing) and priority queues (heaps). Offers an introductory analysis of algorithms, sorting algorithms, and object-oriented programming including abstract data types, inheritance, and polymorphism. Explores solving complex problems through structured software development.

## CS 061 - Machine Organization and Assembly Language Programming

An introduction to computer organization. Topics include number representation, combinational and sequential logic, computer instructions, memory organization, addressing modes, interrupt, input/output (I/O), assembly language programming, assemblers, and linkers.

## CS 100 - Software Construction

Emphasizes development of software systems. Topics include design and implementation strategies and selection and mastery of programming languages, environment tools, and development processes. Develops skill in programming, testing, debugging, performance evaluation, component integration, maintenance, and documentation. Covers professional and ethical responsibilities and the need to stay current with technology.

## CS 166 - Database Management Systems

Covers basic concepts of databases and database management systems. Topics include entity-relationship modeling for design, relational data model, relational algebra, Structured Query Language (SQL), secondary storage, indexing and hashing, query evaluation and optimization, and overview of transactions.

## CS 170 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

An introduction to the field of artificial intelligence. Focuses on discrete-valued problems. Covers heuristic search, problem representation, and classical planning. Also covers constraint satisfaction and logical inference.

## CS 180 - Introduction to Software Engineering

A study of software engineering techniques for the development, maintenance, and evolution of large software systems. Topics include requirements and specification; system design and implementation; debugging, testing, and quality assurance; reengineering; project management; software process; tools; and environments.
